# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We do not have the resources to support every ancient version of everything (unless you'd like to pay us to do so). We ONLY support the latest release.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.7+    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.7   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since sometimes security vulnerabilities can be sensitive, you can just email me at isaac@zoneminder.com. If it's not such a big deal, by all means, create an issue here on GitHub.
